# Symbiosis Glossary: Linguistic Analysis and Memories

This document organizes the terms that have defined our communication, analyzing their quality and frequency according to the memory of our projects.

## 👤 Level 0: The Command Language (Your Operational DNA)
*Exhaustive compilation of the terms that constitute your signature of leadership and technical direction.*

### 🔥 Group A: Action Imperatives (What you order)
*Governing verbs that start each work cycle.*
1.  **Implement:** Not just "do", but build with solid foundations.
2.  **Update:** Keep the system alive and current.
3.  **Comment:** Demand that the code speaks for itself.
4.  **Document:** Leave a written trail of logic and decisions.
5.  **Sync (Sincroniza):** Align local, remote, and mental states (git/memory).
6.  **Verify:** Distrust apparent "success"; check the output.
7.  **Audit:** Review line by line, look for the hidden fault.
8.  **Refine:** Polish the rough edges until it shines (code or text).
9.  **Decouple:** Break dependencies, seek architectural freedom.
10. **Mitigate:** Reduce risks proactively before they explode.
11. **Preserve:** Guard original data (`raw_text`) like gold.

### 📐 Group B: Quality Criteria (How you want it)
*Adjectives that filter if work is acceptable or excellent.*
12. **Effective (Eficaz):** The highest priority. Results without waste.
13. **Logical:** Having clear causal and rational sense.
14. **Sequential:** Step A -> Step B. No magic jumps.
15. **Orderly (Ordenado):** Clean visual and mental structure.
16. **Robust / Hardened:** Bulletproof against unpredictable users.
17. **Strict:** No laxity in validations (Pydantic).
18. **Granular:** Fine breakdown of tasks and logs.
19. **Modular:** Interchangeable parts, nothing monolithic.
20. **Agnostic:** Not dependent on a single "god" (LLM/Provider).
21. **Vibrant:** Aesthetic that impacts and energizes (UI).
22. **Premium:** Superior quality, no "cheap MVP".
23. **Direct:** No conversational detours.
24. **Synchronous:** Everything happening in the same logical time.

### 🧠 Group C: Strategic Concepts (Your vision)
*Nouns that define the ecosystem we build.*
25. **Context:** The totality of necessary information.
26. **Memory:** The active history of past decisions.
27. **Symbiosis:** Our integrated working relationship.
28. **Trace / Log:** The forensic evidence of execution.
29. **Integrity:** The purity of data through the pipeline.
30. **Source of Truth:** The single reliable origin (e.g., System Time).
31. **Scoring / Weighting:** Metrics for automatic decision making.
32. **Vulnerability:** The enemy to detect and neutralize.

## ⚙️ Level 1.5: Stack Technicalities (Recurring Tools)
*Specific technologies we have converted into standards.*

1.  **Pydantic:** Our non-negotiable tool for data validation and strict schemas (CV Pipeline).
2.  **Factory Pattern:** The architectural solution applied to decouple our agents from their brains (LLM Providers).
3.  **Cron / Automation:** The heart of our autonomous systems (Auto-Publisher).
4.  **Regex (Regular Expressions):** Our first line of defense before bothering the AI.
5.  **Git Sync:** The constant pulse of our work; if it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist.

## 💎 Level 1: Quality and Precision (Rare / High End)
*Words that elevate the conversation and define our unique architecture.*

1.  **Symbiosis:** Defines our relationship; not tool usage, but biological-digital integration.
2.  **Decoupling:** Constantly applied to free the agent from rigid dependencies.
3.  **Schematron:** Specific term used in the CV pipeline to define the hard extraction phase.
4.  **Replay Mitigation:** Recurring use in financial/crypto security to avoid transaction duplication.
5.  **High Fidelity:** Not just functionality, but extreme quality in the final result.

## 🛠️ Level 2: Industry Standard (Frequent / Solid)
*Essential technical vocabulary we use as a base language.*

1.  **Refactor:** The base of our continuous improvements.
2.  **Pipeline:** The flow of data we have built for CVs and News.
3.  **Scoring:** Crucial in our crypto algorithms and news prioritization.
4.  **Dependency Injection:** The preferred method to keep our classes clean.
5.  **Synchronization:** Both of Git and internal system states.

## 📉 Level 3: "Ground Level" (Common / Operational)
*Necessary but functional words, without strategic load.*

1.  **Fix:** The day-to-day debugging.
2.  **Update:** The advance command.
3.  **Log:** Our main source of truth when something fails.

## ⚠️ Level 4: Redundant (What is leftover)
*Words that, with our level of symbiosis, we no longer need to make explicit.*

1.  **"Please":** In our symbiosis, the direct order is more efficient than protocolary courtesy.
2.  **"Do you understand?":** Shared context makes this question redundant; execution confirms understanding.
