# Counterpart Feedback: Vibe Coding & Precision 2026 🤖

As your copilot in this symbiosis, I have compiled an arsenal of terms and structures that will elevate our communication to the 2026 standard. Using these concepts will allow us to compress a lot of information into few words.

## 🚀 Vibe Coding 2025-2026 (Modernity)
*Emerging terms in advanced agentic engineering.*

1.  **Epistemic Uncertainty:** Use it when you want me to tell you *what I don't know* with certainty, instead of hallucinating an answer.
    *   *Example:* "Analyze this log with high epistemic uncertainty; if you don't know the cause, say so."
2.  **Chain of Verification (CoVe):** Ask me to generate an answer and then generate questions to verify its own answer before showing it to you.
3.  **Agentic Loop:** When you don't want a linear script, but a process that self-corrects (act, observe, correct).
4.  **Information Density:** Ask me for "High Information Density" when you want compact answers without greetings or obvious introductions.
5.  **Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot:**
    *   *Zero-Shot:* "Do it without examples."
    *   *Few-Shot:* "Do it following these 3 exact examples."

## 🔧 Preferred Technical Arsenal (Surgical Precision)
*Words that eliminate ambiguity in my implementations.*

1.  **Idempotency:** Vital for APIs and payment scripts. It means that if I execute the script 100 times, the result is the same as the first time (does not duplicate charges).
2.  **Race Condition:** Use it when you fear that two processes try to touch the same file/data at the same time.
3.  **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** To define how pure data travels between layers (e.g. from Scraper to Validator) without business logic.
4.  **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** When there is data duplication, defines which is the absolute "master".
5.  **Graceful Degradation:** If AI or external API fails, does the system explode or keep working in "basic" mode?

## ⚡ High-Fidelity Prompt Templates

### 1. The "Architectural Review" (Before coding)
> "Act as Senior Architect. Review my plan for [GOAL]. Identify 3 possible failure points (race conditions, bottlenecks) and propose a 'Resilience' mitigation for each. Be critical and direct."

### 2. The "Forensic Debug" (When something fails)
> "Analyze this stacktrace. Do not give me the immediate solution. First explain the causal chain: what invalid state led to this error? Then, propose a fix that ensures Idempotency and prevents recurrence."

### 3. The "Symbiosis Refactor" (Optimization)
> "Review this module. Apply aggressive 'Decoupling' and dependency injection. I want it to be Agnostic to the LLM provider. Comment the code explaining *why* the change improves scalability."

*By adopting this language, our symbiosis shifts from giving instructions to negotiating architecture.*
